Projects revolving around baseball statistics using machine learning, neural networks, and more.

HOF-binary-classification-project:
Implementing and evaluating the performance of KNN, perceptron, and SVM machine learning models to classify Hall of Fame baseball players based on their statistics. Machine learning models built using the scikit-learn library. Check out the documentation folder for the final project report.

HR-prediction-game:
Using a linear regression model to predict the probabilities of players hitting a home run on a given day. Built a game using React Native where users try to beat the model's predictions. Engineered data pipelines to process and transform realtime player data along with cloud functions for automated updates.

Pitch-classification-nn-project:
Used the Pytorch library to build a neural network which identifies pitch types based on their characteristics. Imported data using the MLB statcast api to train and test the model.
